# Habbify
## The Idea
A small gamified habit tracking prototype.

### Functions
- Create new habits
  - Everyday habits
  - X times a week habits
  - (X times a month habits)
  - (X times a year habits)
- Track habit
- Earn EXP
- Level Up
- (Compete against others in season leaderboards)

### Current To-Dos
- ~~Creating Habit System~~
  - ~~Creating a Habit~~
  - ~~Track the Habit progression~~
- ~~Change is_complete~~
  - ~~should track the timespan according to the selected frequency~~
  - ~~so there is no need to "clear" current Habbits after a period of time to be able to track again~~
- Showing the EXP
  - the total number
  - the amount earned when progressing
  - the amount earned when creating a new one
- Update Habits
  - classic update view
- Detail habit View
  - basic informations (name, freq, target, progression, is_complete)
  - Histroy of completion and earnd EXP

NOTE: for this prototype i want to focus on the EXP as main motivator
