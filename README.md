# Habbify
## The Idea
A small gamified habit tracking prototype.

### Functions
- Create new habits
  - Everyday habits
  - X times a week habits
  - (X times a month habits)
  - (X times a year habits)
- Track habit
- Earn EXP
- Level Up
- Grow your own forest with different kind of birds
  - while progressing habits you can earn eggs
    - eggs are progressing while progressing and completing habits
    - you can get "better" eggs by increasing your level/gaining more EXP
- (Compete against others in season leaderboards)

### Current To-Dos
- ~~Creating Habit System~~
  - ~~Creating a Habit~~
  - ~~Track the Habit progression~~
- ~~Change is_complete~~
  - ~~should track the timespan according to the selected frequency~~
  - ~~so there is no need to "clear" current Habbits after a period of time to be able to track again~~
- ~~Showing the EXP~~
  - ~~the total number~~
  - ~~the amount earned when progressing~~
  - ~~the amount earned when creating a new one~~
- ~~Add basic functions for Birds and Egg collection~~
  - ~~Gain Eggs when completing a habit~~
  - ~~Level all eggs when gaining EXP~~
  - ~~Hatch birds when a threshold is reached~~
- Getting "better" eggs with higher user Level
  - i want at least 2 more eggs to hold different birds to collect
    - therefore i need 2 more egg icons
    - and 3-4 more bird images
  - a function that can pick an egg (better eggs probalbillity should scale with user level)
    - to keep it simple new eggs always start at a 10% chance and inceasing by 10% per level
  - the egg model needs an level threshold to track unlocking
- Update Habits
  - classic update view
- Detail habit View
  - basic informations (name, freq, target, progression, is_complete)
  - Histroy of completion and earnd EXP

NOTE: for this prototype i want to focus on the EXP as main motivator
