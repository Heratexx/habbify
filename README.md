## The Idea
Habbify is a small gamified habit tracking prototype designed to help users build positive habits. It incorporates elements of gamification, such as earning experience points (EXP) and collecting eggs to hatch birds, to motivate users to track and progress their habits consistently.

### Features
- **Create New Habits:** Users can create various types of habits, including everyday habits, habits to be completed a certain number of times per week, ~~per month, or per year.~~
  - currently no UI for month and year
- **Track Habit Progress:** Users can track the progress of their habits, allowing them to monitor their consistency and improvement over time.
- **Earn EXP:** Users earn experience points (EXP) for progressing and completing their habits. EXP serves as a measure of their overall progress and commitment.
- **Level Up:** As users accumulate EXP, they level up, unlocking new features and rewards.
- **Grow Your Own Forest:** Users can grow their own virtual forest by hatching birds from collected eggs. Each bird represents a milestone in the user's habit journey.

### Demo

## Why I Chose this Project
I was drawn to a project that could evolve over time, something I could continuously improve upon. The concept of a gamified habit-tracking application had been on my mind for several month. My friend and I had already brainstormed some rough initial ideas, but life intervened, causing the project to be put on hold for months.

With the theme of "Improving My Life" in mind, I decided to create a prototype of this idea. By incorporating some initial concepts, I believe I'll have a solid foundation to build upon in the future if we decide to pursue the development of the actual application. Moving forward, I plan to actively track my personal habits with habbify and continue refining this project during my weekends.
